Intent-Sense
============

Data Visualization
-----------

`/Arduino/` Code to read, analyze, and visualize data from the IntentSense glove through the serial port.  The Z-Score distance algorithm classifies the use-pattern in real time.


Simulation Algorithms
-----------

`/MATLAB_Algorithms/` To simulate digit amputations and use-pattern detection, algorithms are implemented in MATLAB.  

Algorithms included:

1. Binary Classification Trees
2. Discriminant Analysis (Linear and Quadratic).
3. K-Nearest Neighbor Classification
4. Logistic Regression
5. Naive Bayes Classifer
6. Z-Score Distance
